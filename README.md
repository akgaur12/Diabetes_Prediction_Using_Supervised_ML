## Introduction

Diabetes is a common chronic health condition, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. Machine learning offers a promising approach to predict diabetes risk based on various health-related features.

## Project Overview

This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict diabetes. It includes the following steps:

- Data Collection: We obtained a dataset containing historical patient data, including features like age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.
- Data Preprocessing: We cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and scaling features.
- Model Selection: We experimented with different machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to identify the best-performing model.
- Model Training: We trained the selected model on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: We evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle]. It contains [number_of_samples] samples and [number_of_features] features. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
